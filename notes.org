#+TITLE: Notes for Privacy Paper

* Brainstorm

 - Encryption as an indispensable means to the end of privacy
 - Do I need to spend time on /digital privacy as a right/?
 - I should identify stakeholders and who should care about privacy:
   + Ordinary citizens and how they use encryption
     * Interpersonal communications
     * Online services (e.g. banking)
   + Corporations
     * Protecting user data (/ahem/ Equifax!)
     * Preventing bad actors from damaging our digital infrastructure.

 - It is a contradiction in will for the Attorney General to want access to every piece of encrypted communication while at the same time wanting to protect the US from foreign interference.

 - Case study: Apple vs. FBI in the San Bernardino Case

* Outline

 - Summary of case study: San Bernardino Case
 - Generalize: government has pushed for "responsible encryption" "warrant-compatible encryption"
 - Exploration of conflicting ethical values
   + Justice Department's arguments:
     * Protection of the people
     * Laws demand that Apple and technology suppliers respond to All Writs Act, subpoenas, etc.
   + Apple's arguments:
     * Free speech: Apple doesn't want to create software it considers to be unethical
     * Duty to protect everyone's privacy
 - Technical issues around government's request
   + Keys under doormats
   + Discussion of the importance of mechanisms to protect us against violations of our rights
 - Resolution of case study
   + Government was able to crack encryption with large investment of resources
   + battle continues today; EARN-IT is the latest thrust
